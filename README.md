### Project Overview

#### Introduction
In today’s fast-paced job market, having a resume that meets employer expectations is essential. Our
recommendation system helps bridge the gap between what candidates offer and what employers need. By
analysing resumes through advanced algorithms, we evaluate skills, experience, and education, comparing
them with current job market trends. Our solution doesn’t just identify areas for improvement, it provides
practical suggestions, like skills to acquire or achievements to highlight, helping candidates stand out. With
features like detailed resume analysis, market trend comparisons, and personalized recommendations, we
make it easier for job seekers to craft resumes that truly align with in-demand roles. Future updates will
bring real-time insights to keep candidates ahead in the ever-changing job landscape.

#### Objectives
1. Automate Resume Scoring – Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract and analyse skills,
job titles, and experience from resumes.
2. Enhance Candidate-Job Matching – Implement machine learning models to match resumes with the
most relevant job descriptions based on skill similarity and job role alignment.
3. Identify Skill Gaps – Highlight missing skills in resumes that are required for top job matches, helping
candidates upskill and improve job readiness.
4. Optimize Recruitment Efficiency – Reduce the manual effort in shortlisting candidates, enabling
recruiters to focus on high-potential profiles.
5. Provide Personalized Job Recommendations – Suggest the top 5 most suitable job roles for each
candidate based on their resume content and job market trends.
6. Evaluate & Improve Matching Accuracy – Measure model performance using accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score, ensuring high-quality recommendations.
